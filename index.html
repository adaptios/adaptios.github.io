        <p>Price Adjust is a free app that enables merchants to adjust product prices on their Shopify stores. This Privacy Policy describes how personal information is collected, used, and shared when you install or use the App in connection with your Shopify-supported store.</p>
        
        <h2>Personal Information the App Collects</h2>
        <p>When you install Price Adjust, we automatically access certain information from your Shopify account, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your shop’s products and collections</li>
            <li>Your latest adjustment data (only after an adjustment takes place) to enable the “Revert” functionality</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Do We Use Your Personal Information?</h2>
        <p>We use the information collected from you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Apply your requested price adjustments on products or collections</li>
            <li>Store only the latest adjustment (after an adjustment takes place) to allow you to revert it if needed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use your information for marketing or any other purposes outside of the functionality of the app.</p>

        <h2>Sharing Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties. All data remains secure and is only used to facilitate the app's functionality.</p>
        <p>However, we may share your personal information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant, or other lawful requests for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We only retain your latest adjustment data (after an adjustment takes place) to provide the “Revert” feature. If you no longer wish to use the app, or if you uninstall Price Adjust, all retained data will be deleted.</p>

        <h2>Access to Your Data</h2>
        <p>You have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us using the contact information below.</p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.</p>
