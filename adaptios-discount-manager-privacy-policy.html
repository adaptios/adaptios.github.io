        <p>Discount Manager is a free app that enables merchants to schedule price discounts on their Shopify stores. This Privacy Policy describes how personal information is collected, used, and shared when you install or use the App in connection with your Shopify-supported store.</p>

        <h2>Important Legal Notice</h2>
        <p>Please be aware of the laws within your region related to data privacy. If this app does not comply with your regional data privacy laws, please do not install it. We take no responsibility for any misuse of this app. The data we store about you can be requested, anonymized, or deleted based on your request.</p>

        <h2>Personal Information the App Collects</h2>
        <p>When you install Discount Manager, we automatically access certain information from your Shopify account, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your shop domain and basic store information</li>
            <li>Your products, variants, and collections data required to calculate and apply scheduled discounts</li>
            <li>Schedule details (name, start/end times, adjustment settings, and status)</li>
            <li>Pricing snapshots and adjustment payloads needed to apply discounts and enable rollback/revert functionality</li>
            <li>Banner configuration data (if you enable storefront banners)</li>
            <li>Billing and usage metrics required to enforce plan limits</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Do We Use Your Personal Information?</h2>
        <p>We use the information collected from you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Schedule and apply price discounts to the products or collections you select</li>
            <li>Store pricing snapshots and adjustment data so we can safely revert or roll back scheduled changes</li>
            <li>Track schedule execution status and show you historical results</li>
            <li>Configure optional storefront banners related to your active schedules</li>
            <li>Measure usage for billing and plan enforcement</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use your information for marketing or any other purposes outside of the functionality of the app.</p>

        <h2>Sharing Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties for marketing. Discount Manager only shares data with Shopify as required to apply scheduled discounts and with service providers used to host and operate the app (such as database and hosting providers) under confidentiality obligations.</p>
        <p>We may also share your personal information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant, or other lawful requests for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Discount Manager retains schedule data while schedules are active. We also retain historical pricing snapshots and adjustment details after execution so that you can revert changes and review schedule outcomes. If you uninstall Discount Manager, we delete retained app data associated with your store, subject to legal or accounting obligations.</p>

        <h2>Access to Your Data</h2>
        <p>You have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us using the contact information below.</p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.</p>
